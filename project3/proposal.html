    <h1>Sugar Rush</h1>

    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>As a server, you need to serve food to the correct customer orders. Make a mistake or make the customer wait too long and the cafe will lose money!</p>

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>Management</p>

    <h2>Behind The Scenes</h2>
    <p>The techology stack I will be using to develop the game is Javascript & Browser DOM. It will function similarly to the Chibi Matching example.</p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Very simply, you are a new server at the cafe, [CAFE NAME].</p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>I'm going for a cutesy style with a limited color palette. The main colors will be pastel purple and pastle yellow.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>

    <h2>Mockups</h2>

    <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
