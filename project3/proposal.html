          <h2>High Concept</h2>
          <p>As a server, you need to serve food to the correct customer orders. Make a mistake or make the customer wait too long and the cafe will lose money!</p>

          <h2>Genre</h2>
          <p>Job Simulation, Casual, Point and Click</p>
     
          <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
          <p>I'm going for a cutesy style with a limited color palette. The main colors will be pastel purple and pastle yellow.</p>

          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p>There isn't much of a story. You are just a recent hire at this cafe, Iets Zoets.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="technicalDirection">
          <h2>Platform</h2>
          <p>The game will only be playable using a desktop on the web.</p>
   
          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p>Customers will appear at the window with a text bubble that shows what food item they want to order.</p>

          <h2>Mockups</h2>
          <img src="media/Project 3 Mockup.jpeg" alt="Cafe Serving Mockup"/>

          <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
          <p>To add more to the gameplay, I'd want the players to "craft" the orders with a few ingredients and a Minecraft crafting grid.</p>
