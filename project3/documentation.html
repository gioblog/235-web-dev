    <h2>Process & Requirements</h2>
    <p> I started the project by drawing the minimum needed elements for my game: two customers, two cafe items, background, & speech bubble. Then, I started the HTML with a similar structure to the chibi matching game. 
      Randomly displaying customer order proved challenging because I was confused how the chibi game was adding the visual classes. It also took me many re-reads of the patterns code and the classList.add documentation to understand how it worked.
      I had difficulty implementing drag and drop because I kept mispelling appearance and the cocoa was under some unknown element, so i had to set its z-index to 2 in order to get it to work. 
      I didn't discover the layering issue for awhile though. I didn't get to add all the gameplay complexities I originally wanted due to my issues with drag and drop, 
      not accounting for how long it'd take me to draw the game elements (I'm a really slow artist), and the rabbit hole I fell into learning about the Fisher-Yates 
      Algorithm. It's super facinating.</p> <br>

    <p>For my technology stck I used JavaScript & DOMs. I use DOM to query for elements and amnipulate. For example, like the chibi game, I query for certain classes to
       set the attribute. My game is simple for a user to understand because there is not much explanation needed and how to play isclearly displayed below the game.
        The dseign is pleasin because I drew it myself. I made the customer entity be a class to meet the ES6 requirement. That way I could easily reference the the
        customer type with the order type.</p> <hr>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>I'm really proud with the final product even if it isn't as complex as my original idea. If you watch your money after serving a customer, you will see it 
      enlarge for a little bit before going back to normal. This may be a very unpopular opinion, but I love alert systems so I used it for my game over screen.
      I'm continuing this project over winter break, so if you have any feedback for future development please let me know :></p>
