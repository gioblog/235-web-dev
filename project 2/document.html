  <h2>About The Project</h2>
  <p> I had an extremely hard time implementing the episodes filter because the episodes is its own API within the Rick and Morty API. 
    So, I was trying to load through an API within an API. After spending weeks on this issue and inhibiting my progress, I opted to exclude 
    it from my final project to save my sanity. The three controls in my project is:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Filter selector that allows the user to choose if they see the life status, origin, and/or the species.</li>
      <li>Typing in a term (character) to search for</li>
      <li>Choose if you want characters with no image to display</li>
    </ul>
