    <!-- notes about the project below. What was challenging? What ways did you go 'above and beyond' expectations? -->
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p> I went above expectation in this first iteration of the project by delivering a responsive web for mobile device versus desktop device.
        For the second iteration, I plan to make a third layout for devices simialr to the size of a tablet. I had the most trouble creating the flexbox to 
        group together the tarantuala and chicken breasts advert. Getting the margins and sizes of the flewbox items proved to be difficult. Although one issue was an easy fix 
        of making sure my HTML mared the div as an id rather than a class to match what I had written in my CSS. </p>
