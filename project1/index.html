                                    The last case of cremating those who had new infectious diseases was in 3995 and yet our air quality is still detrimentally affected by such
                                    practices. With our population only just now recovering from these outdated medical practices, the question stands: will our growing 
                                    population be able to survive with the current state of our air quality? Doctors and practitioners alike were previously baffled by the overwhelming 
                                    amount of new infectious diseases developing in our globe sector. Now it's common knowledge (and universally adopted) that poor air quality would 
                                    lead to newly developing diseases. When the max amount of time you can spend outside without a mask shortens down to a maximum of 5 minutes, 
                                    it’s a fact that can no longer be debated. With government researchers announcing breathing mask models of Epinomic 4.35e and below will be
                                    insufficient protection against the air by the holiday season, the tension between the public and the government is palpable. While the government 
                                    has delivered a type of solution via their new contract with HealBlue to distribute Epinomic 5.35e masks (originally only seen on government officials) 
                                    to the public in September of this year, the general public still questions if the government will ever make actual efforts towards a 
                                    long-term solution for our air.

                        <h1>A Mechanoid's Grand Opening</h1> 
                        <p>
                            Today’s review is all about With The Flow: the first mechanoid operated cafe. With such ballyhoo surrounding its recent opening, we decided to 
                            investigate. Immediately entering the cafe, the air lock was decorated with plants floor to ceiling with a quaint spot to store your shoes 
                            before actually going in. Many businesses don’t take advantage of the decorating space the air lock presents them with, so it was intriguing to
                            see that the mechanoid was programmed to do the opposite. Plants continue to flow throughout the cafe with the ground covered with plush 
                            persian rugs. The scent of brown sugar filled the air as Cuban coffee was brewed. The menu, while short, salivates you instantly with unheard 
                            of delicacies like fried plantains (fruity & sweet) and flan (a condensed milk custard with a caramel sauce!). When questioning the mechanoid 
                            (self-named Robot) about the limited menu, it shared its dream of expanding the menu once it could afford to hire a mechanoid for assistance. 
                            Certainly provided us with a chuckle!  What a cute fella. If tasting novel sweets treats and interacting with Robot, the first interactive 
                            mechanoid, piques your interest, definitely come check out With The Flow. Just don’t forget to be wearing socks!
